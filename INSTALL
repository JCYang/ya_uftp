This is not a header-only library, you need to build it.

Requirement

C++17 compiler, gcc 8 or later, clang 6 or later, latest MSVC are ok.
CMake 3.12 or newer.
Not too old Boost with filesystem built(1.66 and newer are fine).

By default, static library will be built, if you need shared library, set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON.
'make install' or 'ninja install' or whatever build system you use will bring you the export headers and libs.

Usage:
include ya_uftp.hpp and link your project to either libuftp_sender or libuftp_receiver.
